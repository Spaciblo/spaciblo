# Spaciblō

The Spaciblō project builds hosting tools for browser based, social, 3D spaces. 

This repository houses the project-wide wiki. 

The [Spaciblō Core](https://github.com/Spaciblo/spaciblo-core) repository holds the Spaciblō simulation server and demo art. That's a good place to start if you just want to dive into the code and see how it works.

[The wiki](https://github.com/Spaciblo/spaciblo/wiki) is a good place to start.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the project goals?

Much like the early days of the web, web VR spaces are currently only hosted by organizations with a lot of resources because it takes a lot of know-how to implement simulators, replication, and renderers.

We want Spaciblō to be at least as easy to install and maintain as blogging servers like WordPress.

People with a bit of command line skills can install it themselves and get started building social spaces without going to school for programming or 3D art. We're also building the back-end to scale so that hosting companies can offer social VR much like they offer blogging software.

### What is done and what needs doing?

Right now, multiple people can point their browsers at a Spaciblō space, see each other in the space, and view the space with their handsets, VR headsets, or laptops.

There are many features missing! There's no physics, no easy way to edit the 3D spaces, and no tools for managing abuse or harassment.

Check out the [core development project lists](https://github.com/orgs/Spaciblo/projects/1) to get a sense of what's on deck.

### I want to help build an open and free web of VR, how do I start?

#### Artists

We can talk about replication strategies until the cows come home, but if the demo spaces are filled with engineer art people will bounce right off. If you'd like to see your ideas (with attribution!) become fundamental to how people remember the early days of VR on the web, contact trevor@trevor.smith.name.

#### Coders

The code is littered with TODO comments. The [core development project lists](https://github.com/orgs/Spaciblo/projects/1) has a growing list of work items. If any of them strike your fancy or there's something that just bugs you about the Spaciblō experience, check out and build the [Spaciblō Core](https://github.com/Spaciblo/spaciblo-core) and take a look around. We may start a dev chat channel soon, but in the meantime contact trevor@trevor.smith.name.

#### Players

We're not far from having something that could be called fun. Hell, just being in a web VR space and seeing people from all over is fun to some people. That said, Spaciblō is not yet a nicely packaged fun machine for people who aren't building the machine itself. (See previous question)

Watch this space!

#### Dreamers

This is the beginning of a new multiverse on the web. Decisions we make now about core aspects like identity, harassement, and monetization will effect VR on the web for years. Bring on the lovers and dreamers!

### Is there a 500' view of the major pieces of Spaciblō?
