# Spaciblō

The Spaciblō project builds hosting tools for browser based, social, 3D spaces. 

We're in the process of switching over to a new set of languages and standards for Spaciblō. This repository will hold the project-wide documents and wiki. 

The [Spaciblō Core](https://github.com/Spaciblo/spaciblo-core) repository will hold the Go based implementation of the Spaciblō tools.

[The wiki is a good place to start](https://github.com/Spaciblo/spaciblo/wiki)
