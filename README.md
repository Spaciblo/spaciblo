# Spaciblō

The [Spaciblō project](https://spaciblo.org/) builds hosting tools for browser based, social, 3D spaces. 

Our goal is to make web based VR tools as easy to use as blogging tools like WordPress.

If you're new to Spaciblō, check out our handy [Frequently Asked Questions page](https://github.com/Spaciblo/spaciblo/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) where you will find out what the heck this is and how to start playing with it. (It's neat, we promise!)

[This repository](https://github.com/Spaciblo/spaciblo) houses the [project wiki](https://github.com/Spaciblo/spaciblo/wiki), which is a good place to start if you're interested in VR on the web.

The [Spaciblō Core repository](https://github.com/Spaciblo/spaciblo-core) holds the Spaciblō server and demo spaces. That's a good place to start if you just want to dive into the code and see how it works.

Check out the [core development project lists](https://github.com/orgs/Spaciblo/projects/1) to get a sense of what we're working on right now.
