# Spaciblō: Hosting tools for browser based, social, 3D spaces.

Hi, we're in the process of switching over to a new set of languages and standards for Spaciblō. This repository will hold the project-wide documents and wiki. 

The [Spaciblo Core](https://github.com/Spaciblo/spaciblo-core) repository will hold the Go based implementation of the Spaciblō tools.

Watch this space.
