# Spacibl≈ç: A Toolkit for Social Spaces on the Web

This code base is, as you may have gathered, no longer under active development. See [the wiki](https://github.com/Spaciblo/spaciblo/wiki) or [@spaciblo](https://twitter.com/spaciblo) for news.

The correct pronunciation of the name of this project is spah-see-blow.
To get the full effect of the name it helps to fake an Italian accent and wave your hands. 

The current code wrangler is Trevor F. Smith: http://trevor.smith.name/

Project status: Not Even Alpha!
The code is very early and is not currently recommended for use outside of development.  We are still laying down the infrastructure for web based simulation and there is no 3D renderer.
